Social Network Blog App.

Sabin Hantu, computer science student.

1st Android App, developed for learning reasons only.

## What I learned

+ Android concepts(activities, fragments, views).
+ Recycler View with 1 or more items.
+ Communicating with a database(i.e. Firebase Firestore): adding and getting data.
+ Using 3rd party libraries(Glide, Image-Cropper, Compressor, etc.).

## Functionalities

+ User Authentification using Firebase Authentification with email.
+ Every user has its own blog stored in Firestore.
+ User's profile picture or name can be updated.
+ Follow (read this blog) system implemented as a collection in Firestore for each user.
+ Like system and comment fragment for each post.
+ Storing images and thumbs via Firebase Storage.
+ Circular Image View for profile images via [CircleImageView by @hdodenhof](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView).
